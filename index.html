      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am Chetan Chandrashekar Gaonkar, a visual creator with skills in photography, cinematography, and basic design. I am basically from a village called Gund, near Dandeli. Growing up in a place surrounded by forests and greenery naturally made me curious about details, colours, and moments around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        That environment built the foundation of my creativity and pushed me towards capturing things I felt connected to. Being close to nature helped me develop a habit of observing — noticing light, shadows, textures, and the quiet stories unfolding around me.

      <h3>Where My Creative Journey Began</h3>
      <p>
        Before I even knew what photography was, I found myself quietly observing how light hits leaves, how shadows move, how colours change after rain, and how nature tells its own story without words.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was drawn to small, often unnoticed moments — textures on tree bark, animals moving through the forest, flowing water, and clouds forming patterns in the sky. These moments made me feel something, and I wanted to freeze that feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I finally got access to a camera, I naturally turned towards nature, landscapes, and wildlife. With every photo, I learned patience, how to understand light, wait for the right moment, choose the right perspective, and tell a story through a single frame. Nature photography became my foundation — it trained my eye, shaped my creativity, and laid the base for everything I do today.

      <h3>From Curiosity to Creative Craft</h3>
      <p>
        I began capturing traditional events, college events, people, moments, and anything visually appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Event photography taught me speed, timing, and confidence — how to work when things are happening fast, how to make people feel comfortable, how to handle pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I was introduced to video editing and designing.
      </p>
      <p>This opened a new world for me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating posters in Canva</li>
        <li>Editing videos in Premiere Pro</li>
        <li>Designing brochures</li>
        <li>Being part of the college design committee</li>
        <li>Learning how visuals can communicate emotion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One step led to another, and soon I was doing freelance shoots, handling clients, and experimenting with both photography and videography.
