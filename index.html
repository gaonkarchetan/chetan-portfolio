      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am Chetan Chandrashekar Gaonkar, a media and marketing professional with experience in content creation, branding, web design, and digital outreach. I come from a village called Gund, near Dandeli. Growing up in a place surrounded by forests and greenery naturally made me observant and curious about details, colours, balance, and the way visuals communicate ideas and emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        That environment shaped the way I see and understand things. Being close to nature helped me develop a habit of observing closely - noticing light, shadows, textures, and how small details come together to tell a story. Over time, this way of observing turned into practical skills that I now use in photography, videography, design, and web work to help startups and businesses present themselves clearly and professionally online.

      <h3>My work in Media, Design & Digital</h3>
      <p>
        Before I began working on websites, branding, or digital campaigns, I was naturally drawn to how visuals communicate messages. I found myself paying attention to how design, colours, layout, and content influence the way people understand and trust a brand, even without much explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was especially interested in creating visuals that felt clear and meaningful — logos that represent identity, posters and brochures that communicate information easily, and digital creatives that connect with people. Working on these elements helped me understand the importance of consistency, simplicity, and purpose in visual communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I gained more experience, my work expanded into website design and digital platforms. I started designing, developing, and deploying websites, along with applying basic SEO practices to improve visibility. Alongside this, I worked on social media, event, and promotional content. This phase became my foundation in media and marketing — shaping how I support startups and organizations in building a strong and trustworthy digital presence today.

      <h3>Events, Content & Collaboration</h3>
      <p>I began working on media-related activities through college events, freelance projects, and collaborative assignments. I was involved in event coverage, promotional content, and short-form digital media, supporting teams wherever visual content and communication were required.</p>
      <p>Working on events taught me planning, coordination, and confidence — how to manage tasks when timelines are tight, how to collaborate with different people, how to adapt quickly on the ground, and how to deliver content that supports event promotion and visibility.</p>
      <p>Later, I became more involved in structured content creation and collaboration work.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supporting event promotions through visuals and digital content</li>
        <li>Creating short-form content for events and online platforms</li>
        <li>Collaborating with teams on content planning and execution</li>
        <li>Assisting a YouTube short-filmmaking team with shooting short-form videos</li>
        <li>Understanding how media supports outreach, engagement, and communication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One experience led to another, and soon I was handling responsibilities independently while also working closely with teams, professionals, and clients. This phase helped me develop a practical understanding of how events, content, and collaboration come together to support marketing, digital outreach, and ecosystem activities.</p>
